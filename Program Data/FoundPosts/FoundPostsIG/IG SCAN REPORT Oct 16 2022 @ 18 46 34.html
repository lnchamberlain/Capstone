Alaska. February 2022 üêï

Paws for Adventure was started by Leslie Goodwin in 1998 after she fell in love with the art of dog mushing while teaching in a remote Alaska village. Now, with over 60 dogs, Paws for Adventure offers one of the most authentic dog sled experiences in Alaska.

This is dog sledding‚Äîand it's not only an Alaskan tradition, but also a state obsession, one that's celebrated every March with the running of the 1,150-mile Iditarod Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome
Incredible experience with these amazing dogs üêï! I‚Äôm glad that they take care of them and love them ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç You can see how dogs are excited and happy! üê∂üéâüêïüòç

Day 1: we went to Kincaid Park. It's an easy and local trail and was a great place to go for their first day in town. The views are pretty good and it is a well populated trail. It's also a great place to see wildlife. The top thing on my moms AK bucket list was to see a moose. And we saw a young bull on the first day. My parents were both excited, but my mom a little more so (the 5th photo was taken just after we saw it ü§£).

-Almost Everything Bagel
-French Toast 
-Milk Glaze w/ Fruity Pebbles 
-Iced Oatmeal 

I‚Äôve never had a savory cookie before, but am a huge fan of everything bagels. This seems to be a controversial opinion, but I really liked the bagel inspired cookie! The flavors worked & it was an out of the box idea‚Äîalways down to try something different. I was hooked after the first bite & it was actually my favorite cookie from this breakfast line up! My least favorite of this week‚Äôs line up was the French toast as I didn‚Äôt like the cake consistency; also thought it was bland. Honestly thought the French toast would be my favorite so was surprised that it ended up at the bottom of my list. Fruity pebbles was my second favorite followed by the iced oatmeal.  I applaud Crumbl for doing something different. It‚Äôs always fun to see how their weekly themes turn out! Go see what you think of the everything bagel inspired cookie & their breakfast line up at the Anchorage location in the Tikahtnu Commons!

" Cultural Tourism in #Alaska takes on many forms. It can be #Native and tribally owned businesses, cultural centers, and museums; it might be Native artists and #storytellers; it may be unforgettable Alaskan excursions, like walking tours, cruises, guided hunting and fishing; it could be unique experiences with Native food and art.

However, the heart, the root of cultural tourism, is much more than that. It‚Äôs the perpetuation of our ways of life; it is healing; language revitalization; it is the accurate telling of #AlaskaNative history; it‚Äôs our youth knowing they are part of a community that is living and vibrant, with a robust future, and that we have had and still have a #powerful story and experience to share." #alaskanativeheritagecenter</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg3nKS7IMUw>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src=''></td></tr><tr><td>09/20/2022 15:06:03</td><td>64.8096935401, -147.8523838666</td><td>veritydreaming</td><td>Julia</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/veritydreaming>link</a></td><td>The last of my Alaska adventures.

Been a MINUTE because of our move from Utah and then having to wait to establish care at this new office in Anchorage. (Still annoyed that the Fairbanks pain doctor wouldn‚Äôt take my caseüôÑ). This new doctor though Dr. Lui knows my previous doctor from school (so that‚Äôs fun) & he spent a good hour with me after his PA had already chatted with me first which made the trip feel more worth while too. 

Since I‚Äôll be doing telemedicine for most of my monthly appointments (coming to Anchorage basically once a quarter) we had to switch up my medications. We have a new plan that‚Äôs a bit different from what Dr. Nelson had me doing. Lowkey terrifying lololol. But in the grand scheme of things my pain management has been all over the place since I got pregnant with Melodi. So if we are gonna shake things up I suppose now is the time to do it.

A few fun facts not in any order:
- 2 passenger coach cars (normally 3), 1 baggage car, 170 passengers, 2 locomotives on front and 1 on back. 
- Total duration , 8:35 duration, top speed in winter: 35mph (faster at up to 50 mph in Summer) for 235 miles.
- Flagship route between Fairbanks and Anchorage takes 12 hours at average speed of 30 mph during winter for 350 miles. 
- Cars built in 1989, customized for Alaskan conditions. These older coaches are more adept for cold conditions. Glass window dual level coaches are difficult to keep warm.
- One baggage coach and two dining coaches.
- Two locomotive provide pull and redundancy but the train has broken down before.
- Emergency food, rations, and blankets are loaded but with generators located on multiple cars, this hasn‚Äôt been cracked. 
- Load factors today at 100 percent. As low as 20 people for entire train during shoulder seasons and dark winter Jan-Feb
- Acquired from the Federal Govt‚Äôt and owned by the State of Alaska.
- Operates profitably with no taxpayer money.
- Freight service is true cash cow. 
- What excites passengers the most: seeing a moose 
- Company owns a number of rail barges with 8 tracks apiece for shipping rail cars from Seattle to railroads‚Äô southern terminus (along with Seward)
- Will operate most conditions down to -20 degrees. Issue isn‚Äôt safety but keeping coaches warm.
- WiFi and phone service very spotty along the way but who cares? The views are stunning!
- Summer trains are much busier May-August with glass dome coaches, first class, 7X weekly service, and routes extended down to Kenai Peninsula from Anchorage. 
- One of the last remaining flag stop trains in America where travelers can flag down the train and it will stop. They have had as many as 50 stops in a single trip. They build buffer into the schedule and can add speed to compensate but too many flag stops means late, late, late!
- Fairbanks to Whittier in Summer is longest route at nearly 14 hours.
- Longest winter route is 12 hour Fairbanks-Anchorage at 360 miles.

I figured I‚Äôd do a post and formally introduce myself üò∏ my name is Jordan, and I am currently living in Fairbanks, Alaska. My husband is in the Army, and we moved up here Summer 2021. I am a Registered Nurse and have been for the last 6+ years. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and seeing all this state has to offer. Alaska is nothing like I expected; it has become one of my all-time favorite locations and is, hands down, the greatest place I‚Äôve ever lived. I have always been interested in taking photos for as long as I can remember. Many memories of me with my disposable camera going around my house when I was in elementary school and taking random photos of my cat, knick knacks, and anything else I could get my hands on. Since living in Alaska, I‚Äôve taken my photography hobby up several levels; honestly, it‚Äôs hard not to as the amazing wildlife and scenery is just asking to be captured. I love being able to photograph what this amazing state entails and sharing it with family, friends, and anyone else who wants to see! I hope everyone enjoys what I have posted so far, and just know there is many more to come! üì∏‚ô•Ô∏è

.
In this post series I‚Äôll share ALL the details about our trip to Alaska where we drove along the Dalton Highway from Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay. I don‚Äôt normally give out the dirty details because I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of value in scouring the internet for hours on end doing your own research. Please, PLEASE, still do that. Be responsible and know how to protect yourself and the places you visit.
.
With all that said, let‚Äôs start with why you SHOULDN‚ÄôT drive the Dalton Highway. üòù I know I‚Äôm really sellin‚Äô this to you so far. The truth is that the Dalton Highway is not your average joe adventure and is definitely not for everyone.
.
1. This is not a pleasure cruise. The Dalton Highway is essentially a really long, extremely remote, very dangerous road to the top of Alaska. To some that screams adventure (üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) to others that sounds like your worst nightmare.
.
2. The Dalton Highway is primarily used as a trucking road to deliver supplies to the oil field operations in Prudhoe Bay. That means this is not a road for tourists. You‚Äôre on truckers turf (more on that later).
.
3. Because of its danger and location you want to know a few things about vehicles and survival tactics. You may be lucky like us and have no issues OR you could be like the folks @lifestyleoverland helped out in a sticky situation. Be prepared! There won‚Äôt always be a Kevin and Sarah to save your bacon.
.
4. Your destination is industrial oil fields. Obviously that‚Äôs not WHY you‚Äôre going there but it‚Äôs the truth.
.
This trip is for bucket listers that crave adventure that boarders on the dangerous side and want to see places not many people in the world will ever see. If that‚Äôs you then you‚Äôll want to stick around for the rest of this series.</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CYaSSxCNTo3>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src='../../../Program Data/Images/ImagesIG/5eca15f3f8f2129961add0adbacfea0c.jpg'></td></tr><tr><td>07/30/2022 17:58:06</td><td>64.8300832798, -147.8660762001</td><td>riverboatdiscovery</td><td>Riverboat Discovery</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/riverboatdiscovery>link</a></td><td>Only 50 days left in our season!

Customary of the ancient traditions of the Athabascan people, the boxes often resembled small wooden cabins on stilts. In a pinch, a tree would be used to support the bear box. The box would encircle the tree, and the tree would act as a support .

¬†Places that have a high amount of predatory or scavenging animals tend to have a history of people using similar containers.
The traditional look for Alaska bear caches is a simple design using a¬†box structure that is raised on four tall legs. The legs are spread apart from each other and at an angle that makes it difficult for tenacious bears (and other animals) to reach the food stored in the box. Boxes would typically open from the front, but it wasn‚Äôt unheard of to see them accessible from the bottom. that would

In Alaska, the main intent of the bear cache was to keep food away from bears and other animals who might be looking for an easy meal. People would employ bear caches to keep perishable and non-perishable goods safe from animals.¬†

Its extremely rare to see Aurora borealis in August, days above the Arctic circle are still long, sun sets after 11pm and the night lasts barely few hours. We were just leaving the hot springs, when one American guy said- watch out for the sky, seems like we're going to have a show tonight, while he showed us a small Ray of light, that I personally wouldn't distinguish from a cloud. We pinched our tent, made some hot tea when the sky started to brighten up with waving rays of light. When I was imagining northern lights before I imagined them more static, whereas turned out they are in constant motion. It was really hard to catch it on a photo, as it's literally photographing a moving subject in the dark. I only made a few photos, was not easy to take your eyes off the spectacle.¬†

Our river ice observation camera was relocated to a high cottonwood tree in March by Beverly Chmielarczyk, Allen Bondurant , and Chris Arp in a location they thought would be stable and provide a good view of an area of the #Kuskokwim 

River prone to early winter open-water and spring ice jams. Sustained high water this summer however rapidly eroded the bank and Mark Leary of #Napaimute notified us of its precarious situation.Most fortunately, Mark altered Mr. Samuelson who responded with skiff, chainsaw, and field crew in tow its rescue. 

Not only did Earl save the project's camera from the river, but offered to relocate it to a new site downstream of Bethel where open-water and ice jam flooding are also a common problem. Check out this new real-time station near Napaskiak this winter and thanks again for this amazing effort to put fresh eyes on ice!

Engine upgrades, an exhaust cam was replaced with a more radical E3134 racing cam, making both the intake & exhaust the same, which it now had in common with the Bonneville. 1-1/8-inch cam followers continued to be specified for both inlet & exhaust. The ‚ÄòRed Dot‚Äô outer valve springs were replaced by ‚ÄòGreen Dot‚Äô springs with 10% more load when fully open, but retaining the original loading when closed. Starting with Engine #DU81209 the internal oilways in the rocker arms were deleted, adding strength to cope with the stronger springs. Stronger connecting rods with a greater cross-section & the H&G pistons were redesigned (removing the bar under the crown & thickening the ring groove-area. Left-hand threads were specified for the tachometer (rev counter) drive. To make more room for wrenches (spanners) the cylinder base nuts were changed to 12-points.

TIMING IS EVERYTHING
For the 1968 Triumph TR6, there were 3 different ignition timing regimens indicated on the crankcase & flywheel providing TDC (Top Dead Center) & 38-degrees BTDC (Before Top Dead Center

GEARBOX STUFF
Lots of internal changes were made to the gearbox including the mainshaft high gear, oil seals, clutch operating mechanism & the whole thing was converted over to UNF threads. The 1968 Triumph TR6 got a new primary cover with a round removable inspection plate over the rotor to aid ignition timing. And staring with Engine #DU85346 a pointer was added to the crankcase to aid in the process.
BIG NEWS: NEW TLS FRONT BRAKE
The 1968 Triumph TR6 received an all-new 8-inch TLS (Twin Leading Shoe) front brake, arguably the best Triumph Motodycles ever put on a classic Triumph. It worked very well & it looked great‚Ä¶

Recovery is arguably one of the most important aspects of training. Without it, sustaining long periods of training is nearly impossible. But we often overcomplicate things.

üëâDo the foundational things! Sleeping and adequate rest are where are bodies adapt to training. Without adequate sleep, we become fatigued and lose out on some of the performance adaptations we want.

üëâNutrition is just as critical. Without the fuel, we can‚Äôt recover or sustain high training volumes.

üëâIf you are doing this things well congrats! This is when things like cold immersion or massages may add to your recovery.

The amendment, sponsored by Senator Roger Holland, (R-Anchorage), Senator Donny Olson, (D-Golovin), and Senator Tom Begich, (D-Anchorage), and passed the Senate unanimously.

Based on feedback from Indigenous language stakeholders, the amendment ensures every component is culturally responsive and meets the unique needs of students across the state ‚Äì urban and rural. For example, reading specialists funded by this legislation would require Indigenous language training, an understanding of the community and culture, and live within the school district. Also, the reading tools used by educators can be in any language. 

House Bill 114 heads back to the House of Representatives for a concurrence vote. If the House concurs, the legislation will head to the Governor‚Äôs office for signature, ensuring universal, voluntary pre-K, reading support, and increased funding for school districts. 

‚ÄúTo better our education outcomes, we must reinforce the steps we have made to expand education and provide high-quality, voluntary pre-K to ensure kids are ready to learn and to make sure every child has the ability to read by third grade. We can continue down the status quo path or make necessary and desperately needed improvements so our youngest has the best opportunity for success later in life. This bill will achieve that goal.‚Äù - Senator Tom Begich

My latest story for @growersandco is a profile of @calypso_farm, a 30-acre farm, educational & ecology center in Fairbanks, Alaska. I wasn‚Äôt sure what farming in the cold-climate Boreal forest looked like, but you‚Äôd be surprised at how a mix of produce ü•¶ ü•ï, fiber, flowersüíê, herbs, seed-starting houses, greenhouses & careful attention to siting (for example slope & aspect of fields) can make for a very long growing season. There‚Äôs also time for a few restorative winter months of wool spinning, pattern making, farm planning & all-purpose hibernating‚ò∫Ô∏è.
.
Add the farm‚Äôs strong commitment to food justice & food sovereignty, from the establishment of a pay-what-you-can farmers market to indigenous farmer & community leader training program & you have an dynamic community that‚Äôs a model of how to build a local food system.

The dalton highway was created in 1974 and provides the only road that connects the trans-Atlantic pipeline to the rest of the world. It‚Äôs considered the loneliest road in America because it is the most isolated and least traveled. It‚Äôs considered one of the most dangerous roads in the America and actually made it on episode one of ‚Äòthe most dangerous roads in the world‚Äô. The road has also be featured on episode two of ‚Äòthe worlds toughest jobs‚Äô and was the road traveled in the series ‚ÄòIce road truckers‚Äô. The highway only has two places to stop for fuel and supplies and is located 100s of miles from medical help. Trucks have the right of way on this highway and you can feel the force push against your car as they pass you at almost 80miles an hour on the gravel (for the record I went about 45). This highway is banned by most rental car companies (oops) and has claimed the lives of dozens of people. I only drove about a third of the way just to get to the artic circle but, I hope to come back and complete the entire road so I can say I drove all the most dangerous roads in Alaska (dalton is the last one I need) think @jdecava is down to come?? The road runs parallel to the pipeline and you can see it snaking along side you. Other than that, the highway looks like another planet, like I took a hard left and went to Mars. The last picture is what the back of my car looked like after. I stopped for gas on my way back down the highway and the faces of the huge Alaskan truckers when they found out I drove a Nissan all the way to the artic circle by myself will make me laugh FOREVER!! The state of the car also attracted a lot of attention (no way I‚Äôm spending money cleaning a rental) so the crazy faces of the people that found out kept up till I dropped the car back off. My favorite was a man at wrangler national park asking if I was a seasonal employee, when I told him the mess was from dalton he laughed and said ‚ÄòI‚Äôd lock my daughter up in her room forever if she ever pulled that kind of nonsense‚Äô.

This rare sea duck spends winters in large flocks on watery openings in the pack ice of the Bering Sea. 

In summer, they breed along the coast of Siberia and in two coastal locations of Alaska: the Yukon Delta refuge and the high Arctic coastal plain.

That's why we're running towards Friday like this male spectacled eider, taking off from its breeding grounds on Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.

 ü¶Ü Spectacled eiders are sea ducks that breed in three locations in the world: the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the northern Arctic coast of Alaska, and the northern coast of Siberia.

üåäIn the winter, the entire population gathers in the Bering Sea to feed at one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world. #NationalOceanMonth

üßäSpectacled eiders have an intricate connection to sea ice, and collect in dense flocks to dive into "persistent polynyas" - a matrix of open water in the drifting ice. As the climate changes, biologists are asking more research questions about the effects of ice on the health of the population, which was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1993.

Not only that but you can also rent kayaks, SUP, and canoes üõ∂. Why am I sharing this information? Because if you‚Äôre new to open water swimming and don‚Äôt feel safe swimming alone, maybe you have a friend (who‚Äôs not as crazy about swimming) who would be willing to follow at a safe distance to provide you peace of mind (or a float to grab onto)!

Also m, it‚Äôs a great location for family gatherings!

Add it to your list for next season. 

Pssst. ü•∂ Winter is just around the corner and soon, they‚Äôll have ice houses available for ice fishing. Make sure you get out of the house!

There was a time I struggled with sharing my yoga photography on Instagram. 

I had this fear that others would judge me as being a cliche yoga influencer who was materialistic, narcissistic, & showed off. 

I struggled with how teachers I respected would view me for sharing my practice online. 

I wanted so badly to advocate against the stereotype that watered down true yoga. 

Then I started to finally embrace it. I kept posting & sharing because it helped me process experiences. 

It offered me an outlet to creatively express how much Alaska inspires my work. 

Here‚Äôs the thing... I‚Äôve been taking self-portrait photographs since I was 15. 

I started with a point & shoot camera & spent lots of time in a darkroom. 

I‚Äôve been inspired by photography, sharing my writing & how nature moves me since MySpace. 

Some of you may have known me way back then... I was ALL about photography and I was my best subject. 

I created ethereal scenes in nature wearing dresses & flowers & colors to evoke emotion. 

So now I continue to post these photos because I‚Äôve been doing it for 17 years & I absolutely love it. 

I am still committed to sharing how much my personal practice isn‚Äôt always backbends in an exotic location. 

It also looks like falling asleep on the floor when I practice yoga nidra. üòÇ

But if you get to know the woman in front & behind the camera... you‚Äôll know I‚Äôm not the cliche yoga girl. 

I‚Äôm messy, sleepy, compassionate, funny, adventurous, artistic, and deeply passionate about bringing yoga to ALL bodies. 

I teach how to do yoga in a chair, gentle movements to release stress, meditation to heal the heart, & my classes are very inclusive. 

I teach gentle & therapeutic yoga not only for your body, but your mental health too. 

Because if you know this woman, then you know my journey has had lots of suffering that I‚Äôve climbed out of. 

A yoga therapist is defined as someone who wants to relieve suffering of others.

And I‚Äôll keep sharing my yoga photos in Alaska because there is nothing more deeply healing than nature & remembering we are the microcosm i</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CQGtm6NH-pW>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src='../../../Program Data/Images/ImagesIG/f3b4a6662664e0967a28655af51cd948.jpg'></td></tr><tr><td>09/19/2022 17:02:36</td><td>61.234449, -149.864124</td><td>partners_club_coffee</td><td>east high coffee club</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/partners_club_coffee>link</a></td><td>east high partners club is officially open !

We offer unlimited CrossFit classes and a dedicated nutrition coach to support your wellness goals üí™üèº 

Alex worked with Coach Deborah Morales - Precision Nutrition. This program educates with nutrition science and behavior-change coaching. They built a plan to work towards healthier habits; improving sleep, stress-management, athlete nutrition, and more!
@poweryourlifenutrition 

‚ö°Ô∏è What was your experience working with Coach Deb?

‚ÄúCoach Deb is blistering with enthusiasm when it comes to fitness and nutrition. Her positive attitude makes for a really knowledgeable and motivating program. 

She was available to answer any questions or concerns, and gave extensive feedback and research on how to improve your overall physical and mental well-being. 

Her encouragement is absolutely paramount for my success with the program!‚Äù

‚ö°Ô∏è What is your advice to a newbie starting a nutrition program?

‚ÄúMy advice for anyone new to nutrition, is consistency and patience. 

This is a long journey that really doesn't have a final destination. The overall experience of better health is the ultimate goal, so don't become hung up on instant results. 

Your body recompositing is vastly more important in the long run when starting your nutrition journey.¬†

For the duration of the program (6 months) I only lost about 4 to 5 pounds. However, I lost several inches of my waist and maintained my muscle mass during the whole process. Huge win!‚Äù

Thanks so much Alex! @alexthelion907

Location - Gold Dredge 8, Fairbanks

Some interesting facts about gold in Alaska:

Gold was officially designated the state mineral of Alaska in 1968. The Alaska Gold Rush brought thousands of adventurers and schemers to Alaska and the Yukon in the mid 1800's and again early in the 1900's when gold was discovered near Fairbanks. They all came dreaming of riches - their dramatic frontier stories are both triumphant and tragic.

Claw and tooth marks on the rear of the bison indicate that it was killed by a North American lion, an extinct Ice Age cat that was 25% larger than the modern lion. The lion managed to open the bison carcass and eat most of its muscle located in the ribs and upper limbs area. However, the bison carcass froze quickly, making it difficult for scavengers to fully consume. 

In 1984, a group of paleontologists decided to cook and eat part of the neck muscle of the bison carcass. Professor emeritus of zoology at the University of Alaska, R Dale Guthrie, wrote about the event:

‚ÄúTo climax and celebrate [taxidermist] Eirik Granqvist‚Äôs work with Blue Babe, we had a bison stew dinner for him and for Bjorn Kurten ‚Ä¶ A small part of the mummy‚Äôs neck was diced and simmered in a pot of stock and vegetables. We had Blue Babe for dinner. The meat was well aged but still a little tough, and it gave the stew a strong Pleistocene aroma, but nobody there would have dared miss it.

The meat in its abdomen had spoiled before the bison was completely frozen. But in the neck area small pieces of meat were found attached to the skull. The lions had left so little there that it had frozen through while the meat was still fresh. When it thawed it gave off an unmistakable beef aroma, not unpleasantly mixed with a faint smell of the earth in which it was found, with a touch of mushroom. About a dozen of us gathered .... on April 6, 1984, to partake of Bison priscus stew. The taste was delicious, and none of us suffered any ill effects from the meal.‚Äù

(Harlan Miller)

Natale √® per sempre, non per un giorno soltanto, / l‚Äôamare, il condividere, il dare, non sono da mettere da parte / come i campanellini, le luci e i fili d‚Äôargento in qualche scatola su uno scaffale. / Il bene che fai per gli altri √® bene che fai a te stesso.
(Norman Brooks)

Una candela di Natale √® una bella cosa;
Non fa rumore,
Ma dolcemente offre se stessa.

I finally had success with the process when I worked with my own palette of colors and used a palette knife to direct my splatters. With this process you have to be open to surprises‚Ä¶for instance my beautiful reflections are not located in the same place as my reference and as my colors ran an interesting gray blue that showed up which I really liked!

Geran Tarr</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/gerantarr>link</a></td><td>Hello! It's been a week since we finished and passed Alaska‚Äôs Consent Bill, HB 5, as part of HB 325. It was a very emotional experience and the hardest I've ever worked to pass a piece of legislation. I have enjoyed so much this last week of messages I have received and posts I have been tagged in to see how important this is to so many Alaskans. Wow!
¬†
I wore white when I was sworn in in 2021, and I dedicated my service to the women and children of Alaska and their right to live free of violence. This was my commitment. On the last day of the session at about 8:30 pm, we were able to pass the most important public safety legislation I have ever had the honor of working on.
¬†
Please see my Rep. Tarr Facebook page for the all the details! 
¬†
HB 5 rewrites our consent definition to an affirmative definition that consent is a freely given, reversible agreement specific to the conduct at issue. It also defines the crime of rape by fraud, and finally requires that rape kits be tested within six months. This was the last piece of our multi-year Rape Kit Reform Initiative that we have been working on since 2014.
¬†
So many people worked so hard to get this bill passed and we want to share our gratitude for their continued support. We give special thanks to Katie Botz, survivor and advocate, Lisa Ellanna of Nome, who helped us write the bill and provide invited testimony, Michael Patterson, who helped with public events and organizing, Brian Hosken and Kathleen Navarre of the Alaska School Activities Association for their invited testimony, Keeley Olson and Jennifer Brown of Star Alaska for their help with making sure we have a victim centered approach, Carmen Lowry (former ANDVSA ED), Senators Kiehl and Holland for their support on the Senate floor, and Brenda Stanfill of the Alaska Network on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault for their input and help, and Diane Casto of the Council on Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault - Alaska for her input and help. We also want to thank the more than 200 Alaskans who participated in meetings, sent emails, sent videos, called in to testify, and more.
¬†
It was beautiful to end how we started, with Rep. Rasmussen and Senator Hughes!</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CeCp_xLpZ7U>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src=''></td></tr><tr><td>08/05/2022 19:00:09</td><td>61.16674, -149.84997</td><td>heartsandhandsofcare</td><td>Hearts & Hearts Of Care</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/heartsandhandsofcare>link</a></td><td>On Monday afternoon we went to That Feeling Co. in Anchorage.

For those young aviators that saw this go down. Understand that this is not ok. Ingenuity is great and there is a legal way to get things attached to an airframe. This was not it. We are 100% lucky that this thing didn‚Äôt come off in flight and either hit the gunner or strike the aircraft.

Children from this area inherit their rights to fishing, hunting, and gathering lands; names; the use of crests and designs of totem poles and clothing through their mother.

Children are also raised by their aunts and uncles! They believe parents would "spoil" and "baby" their own children, versus a no-nonsense, stricter upbringing from an aunt and uncle.

We learned so much at the Alaska Native Heritage Center!

Tonight, Cherry Tacang of Cherry‚Äôs Fresh Foods will be serving up her Burmese Coconut Chicken Noodle Soup, a staff and customer favorite. This marks your last chance of the season for Cherry‚Äôs noodles, and an overcast fall day basically necessitates soup for dinner in our opinion.

Don‚Äôt forget that all SNAP/EBT, WIC, and Senior Voucher users will get an extra $30 towards their produce for the next two weeks! That‚Äôs free, fresh picked veggies!!

Our laundry room is usually closed and off limits to the kitties so that they don‚Äôt sleep on clean laundry, but because we had a guest last week, we temporarily moved their litter box from the guest bathroom the laundry room. Somehow a bottle of laundry detergent was knocked over and leaked on the floor. We think that  miss Artemis walked through the spill and got some detergent on her paws. She would have then kicked her paws to clean them, as she is fastidious even for a cat. Andrew found her in our room, passed out and drooling. She had severe chemical burns in her mouth. Thankfully @mt.mckinleyanimal was open over the weekend and we were able to get her immediate care. Then our vet, Dr. Rember at @chenavet took care of her for most of the week, making sure she had pain care and was getting enough food and water. She is now mostly back to normal, her tongue has healed enough that she is eating and drinking normally and back to grooming herself as well. She is still getting what pain meds she will allow me to sneak down her throat with a blob of butter. Both of us will be relieved when that is no longer needed. I don‚Äôt know how parents of actual little humans can deal with events like this, I thought my heart was being ripped out of my chest.

You CAN heal and these Survivor Sessions were created to not only show you that you are not alone, but to also show you the ways that we can heal, release shame, and reclaim our power!

Today's episode features Denali. @nali_cakes is an Advocate at @star.alaska and a Survivor. She shares so much valuable info on healing tools, how advocates can help you, and she bravely shares her own story of overcoming.

If you are struggling right now, I hope that this episode helps you remember that you are worthy, you are capable of healing, and you are not alone. xo</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CGqaepiHg3c>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src='../../../Program Data/Images/ImagesIG/ac6370f4964254db05176c8c4f179ed6.jpg'></td></tr><tr><td>06/04/2022 08:53:48</td><td>61.234449, -149.864124</td><td>elenakonikkos</td><td>ELENA KONIKKOS</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/elenakonikkos>link</a></td><td>You are the music in meü§ç #youarethemusicinme #hsm #highschoolmusical #troybolten #gabriellamontez #vanessahudgens #zachefron #wildcats #singing #music #songs #vocals #lovesongs</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CeYJZ6AJ-OV>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src='../../../Program Data/Images/ImagesIG/416c78a2a358798b619a8f72fc6d2a0b.jpg'></td></tr><tr><td>02/16/2022 08:36:46</td><td>61.2027094753, -149.769032267</td><td>iron_cavazos</td><td>Vincent Cavazos</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/iron_cavazos>link</a></td><td>Vibe check! @tara_cavazos

‚Å†
During the winter months, the park is transformed, providing adventurous outdoor enthusiasts with a variety of exciting recreational activities. The park has it all, from ice fishing to snowmobiling. Snowshoeing, skiing, and staying in the winter cabins located along the shoreline are all options for winter enthusiasts. Because the road to the ice fishing huts and cabins is not plowed during the winter, it is best to travel in a 4x4.‚Å†

di Chris Bomb

Adam Von Kakke eÃÄ un ex galeotto olandese andato a vivere nelle isole Fiji dove gestisce il resort piuÃÄ bello di tutti: ‚ÄúIl corallo nell‚Äôarmadio‚Äù.
Da qualche tempo molti clienti si lamentano in quanto nelle cabine e nei bungalow entrano insetti e ragni di diverse dimensioni.
Essendo presenti sull'isola diverse specie autoctone pericolose e velenose - e volendo lui mantenere il titolo di resort migliore - decide di esporre nella hall una tabella riassuntiva di tutte le specie di ragni in ordine di pericolositaÃÄ con dei colori (il meno pericoloso di color senape, il piuÃÄ pericoloso di color grigio cometa, in mezzo tutte le sfumature) e - decisione ancor piuÃÄ ambiziosa - di attaccare a ogni esemplare del resort il cartellino del colore corrispondente.
Il ragno piuÃÄ pericoloso eÃÄ il terribile Sammartin il quale, avendo proteine Cinghios nel veleno che secerne, trasforma chi viene punto in un essere umano rozzo che parla un dialetto incomprensibile ai piuÃÄ e che ama generare risse spostandosi su di un Ciao Piaggio truccato.
Purtroppo l‚Äôidea di pinzare i ragni con etichette risulta fallimentare e tutti gli inservienti del resort diventano in poco tempo dei Cinghios, nome derivante dalla stessa proteina.
Nel giro di poche settimane il resort diventa un bivacco di buzzurri in Ciao che fanno risse e tifano squadre di calcio dilettantistiche della periferia ferrarese.
Adam non sa come fare, ma un cliente lo salva dai guai organizzando una sfida tra i Cinghios, impossessatisi di fatto del resort, e i nativi di un‚Äôisola oceanica sconosciuta, cattivissimi e puliti, dei quali Adam eÃÄ amico in quanto patron del festival dei fili di banana piuÃÄ importante che ci sia (il FDFDBPICCS).
I capitoli finali sono tutti incentrati sulla rissa che termineraÃÄ con un colpo di scena solo per i lettori di origine peruviana.

(I haven‚Äôt moved yet. The work is just about to startü§™. I‚Äôll definitely be posting when I do move)

I am feeling sooo many feelings all at once. 

Stoked and terrified definitely are my top 2 BUT these words I keep hearing from many close friends keep playing in my head‚Ä¶

Your Fear Means You‚Äôre Moving In The Right Direction üëèüèΩ

So I wanted to share this with you all!! 

The next time you feel overwhelmed by your biggest dreams, remember, it‚Äôs impossible to live without fear. It‚Äôs impossible to remain calm, cool, and collected at all times. However, as long as you‚Äôre choosing pathways that excite you, as long as you‚Äôre embarking upon journeys that you know are going to bring you happiness, then you should push your fear aside. Push your doubts aside. Push your reluctance aside.

You don‚Äôt want to keep putting off something important to you, simply because you‚Äôre nervous about what is waiting for you around the bend. You can‚Äôt fall back on procrastinating. You can‚Äôt wait until tomorrow to start crossing off items on your checklist. You need to chase after your dreams, even though it‚Äôs scary. You need to put effort into finding self-fulfillment, even if it takes you a while.

When your life is too comfortable, it could mean that you‚Äôre in exactly the right place. Or it could mean that it‚Äôs time to push yourself a little more, to branch out, to explore your limitless possibilities. Remember, sometimes, fear is a good thing. Sometimes, it means you‚Äôre heading in the right direction. It means what you‚Äôre doing excites you. It means what you‚Äôre doing matters.

I love you all soo very much! 
 I would not be here today without all of my beautiful clients. 

I can‚Äôt wait to welcome all of you beauties into my new beautiful peaceful place.</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CdpgxlGOdvv>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src='../../../Program Data/Images/ImagesIG/5034c40929da36a0644542f24d4fe2cf.jpg'></td></tr><tr><td>07/21/2021 19:50:47</td><td>61.2175, -149.8917</td><td>fleyedr</td><td>Ladd</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/fleyedr>link</a></td><td>Swinging for kings was a little more difficult this year in various places due to poor runs, small fish, poor timing and high/muddy water‚Äî-but this chunky, dime bright hen kept it real, crushing a tube fly mid swing. #kingsalmon, #wildsalmon, #speyfishing, #flyfishing, #catchandrelease, #alaska, #adventure</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CRmgGOZDuwG>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src='../../../Program Data/Images/ImagesIG/6573683ac05ea1f53b74ae4e8f5ca70c.jpg'></td></tr><tr><td>08/10/2022 19:36:02</td><td>None, None</td><td>rj_chalaki_chandu</td><td>BoBBy‚ÄôsKuTTy..üë´üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/rj_chalaki_chandu>link</a></td><td>WoT a ThRiLLiNG ExPeRieNCe..!! üßä‚ùÑÔ∏è üöÅ #glaciers #helicopter @alaskahelicoptertours #mindblowing #experience #anchorage #alaska #vacation #summerbreak #august #2022 #beautiful #trip #myboys #mymrbob #myhubzy @rj_bobby_bangaram #mummasboy #bossbennyüòéü§ò @arjunprasadkasibhotla #love #family #crazyfamily #telugucouple #comedycouple #couplegoals #crazycouple #parentsvisit #trip</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/ChF0OERjkNB>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src='../../../Program Data/Images/ImagesIG/4447a97d4c7ff56a5587c98c7c71fc4a.jpg'></td></tr><tr><td>10/02/2022 17:17:51</td><td>61.24862968, -149.6954935325</td><td>rebeccaleannphotography</td><td>Rebecca Leann Photography</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/rebeccaleannphotography>link</a></td><td>When's the last time I posted an image turned black & white.

- Cars built in 1989, customized for Alaskan conditions. These older coaches are more adept for cold conditions. Glass window dual level coaches are difficult to keep warm.
- One baggage coach and two dining coaches.
- Two locomotive provide pull and redundancy but the train has broken down before.
- Emergency food, rations, and blankets are loaded but with generators located on multiple cars, this hasn‚Äôt been cracked. 
- Load factors today at 100 percent. As low as 20 people for entire train during shoulder seasons and dark winter Jan-Feb
- Acquired from the Federal Govt‚Äôt and owned by the State of Alaska.
- Operates profitably with no taxpayer money.
- Freight service is true cash cow. 
- What excites passengers the most: seeing a moose 
- Company owns a number of rail barges with 8 tracks apiece for shipping rail cars from Seattle to railroads‚Äô southern terminus (along with Seward)
- Will operate most conditions down to -20 degrees. Issue isn‚Äôt safety but keeping coaches warm.
- WiFi and phone service very spotty along the way but who cares? The views are stunning!
- Summer trains are much busier May-August with glass dome coaches, first class, 7X weekly service, and routes extended down to Kenai Peninsula from Anchorage. 
- One of the last remaining flag stop trains in America where travelers can flag down the train and it will stop. They have had as many as 50 stops in a single trip. They build buffer into the schedule and can add speed to compensate but too many flag stops means late, late, late!
- Fairbanks to Whittier in Summer is longest route at nearly 14 hours.
- Longest winter route is 12 hour Fairbanks-Anchorage at 360 miles.

Every single one of you have made such an impact on my life not just as a coach, but as a person. It has been amazing to watch you all grow not just as an athlete, but seeing you all develop into confident, young adults has been so rewarding. Thank you all for helping me grow the Service cheer program, because with out you guys being AWESOME there would not be continued interest in cheer. You all have worked so hard this season and proved to everyone that y‚Äôall are not just a group that sits on the sidelines to ‚Äúlook cute‚Äù, y‚Äôall are the definition of true athletes. I hope that you all continue to grow in strength and KEEP YOUR GRADES UP!

‚ô•Ô∏èMY JUNIORS & SENIORS‚ô•Ô∏è
I have loved being your guys coach these past few years. You all are smart and determined young adults and I know you all will go out into the world and do amazing things. Thank you for the seasons of dedication. We have been through some ups and downs, but you guys pushed through and worked hard. You guys never cease to amaze me. 

‚≠êÔ∏èMY FRESHMEN & SOPHOMORES‚≠êÔ∏è 
I know I haven‚Äôt coached you guys for very long, but I wanted to thank you guys for joining into the craziness! I hope that being your coach for a short time made you love this sport. I hope that y‚Äôall continue on to basketball season and continue to grow. 

Just cause I‚Äôm gone doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not just a phone call/text away. I will always be a none judgmental ear you can vent to and I‚Äôll always try and give y‚Äôall the best advice I can. 

I LOVE YOU GUYS!!

ONC Votes To Not Retain Mark Springer As Executive Director: Springer has worked at ONC for just over a year. He said that he had no comment at this time. (Photo: Christine Trudeau for KYUK)

Alaska DEC Commissioner Upholds Contested Water Quality Certificate For Donlin Gold Mine: In April, Administrative Law Judge Kent Sullivan ruled that Donlin Gold‚Äôs mining operations would not guarantee a ‚Äúreasonable assurance‚Äù that the mine would meet and maintain state environmental and water quality standards, specifically for mercury levels, water temperature, and salmon habitat. (Photo: Dean Swope for KYUK)

Visiting Construction Workers Extinguish Fire In Crooked Creek: ‚ÄúWe had a bunch of fire extinguishers there and everyone to help. But realistically at that time, the flames were so large that he couldn't get close enough to use a fire extinguisher,‚Äù said Kane Peacock. (Photo Kane Peacock for Brice Inc.)

Fishing Closures Begin On Yukon River: With a weak run of king salmon predicted, managers are being forced to close salmon fishing as the kings begin to arrive. (Photo: Katie Basile for KYUK)

What you will miss most: I will miss creating learning situations that work for students. Nothing has given me more joy than helping students learn.
Plans for Life after Lathrop: I am a declared candidate for the State House, so I'll be campaigning this Fall, and if elected, I would represent District 35 in Juneau next Spring.
Words of Wisdom: One quote that has been on my wall since I arrived at Lathrop in 2003: "No piece of writing is ever finished. It's just due," Susan Stitham.

Maybe that‚Äôs why home never really feels like the four roofed walls that we live in but in the middle of the wilderness where we can move freely and yet still find our footing. Whatever place brings us the most peace from the noise. 

I think as adults we understand the importance of finding places where we can just be. Where routines and daily stressors take a back seat. Sometimes we forget that our kids need that as well. 

Encouraging habits like getting out for a run, hike, bike ride, whatever they enjoy, when things feel overwhelming can be an important piece to them being able to to identify their own places and coping strategies later in life. Places where they can clear their heads and take a minute to catch their breath. 

This life is messy and chaotic and we all need a place we call ‚Äòhome.‚Äô üñ§

I most appreciated learning from an approach different from my original training for my COMT. Language and treatment with a different lens, but with the same aim of providing optimal patient care. 

Icebreaker skill for the start of class was breaking twine and cracking bananas with just the right force and amplitude for the specific joint cavitation. I may never open üçå the ‚Äònormal way‚Äô ever again!

- Pride Plant Swap is from 5pm - 7pm with co-host @acoupleof_plants! This portion of the day requires a sign up though our website, the $5 sign-up fee is a full donation to @identityalaska. Identity Alaska advances Alaska's LGBTQIA2S+ community through advocacy, education, health care and connectivity.

Parking is our biggest hurtle with events, so please let us know if we can guide you in any way. Our lot fills up quick so we recommend on street parking near the shop. Dow Road, next to Superior Auto and across the street behind O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs are our recommendations.

They made it a nonprofit so that they could devote equal time to hands-on education as well as farming. In over two decades of operation, they‚Äôve developed a dizzying range of products and services: close to 500 different varieties of vegetables, herbs, and flowers to promote diversity and resilience; farmer and community garden leader training programs; elementary school farm classes, and curriculum materials. All serve their goal of promoting food justice and food sovereignty, and their efforts have made them a trusted member of the Fairbanks food system. ü•í

Avec son mari, Tom Zimmer, Susan Willsrud a fond√© la ferme Calypso en 2000. üêè

Ils en ont fait un organisme √† but non lucratif afin de pouvoir consacrer autant de temps √† l'√©ducation pratique qu'√† l'agriculture. En plus de deux d√©cennies d'activit√©, ils ont d√©velopp√© une gamme vertigineuse de produits et de services : pr√®s de 500 vari√©t√©s diff√©rentes de l√©gumes, d'herbes et de fleurs pour promouvoir la diversit√© et la r√©silience ; des programmes de formation d'agriculteurs et de gestionnaires de jardins communautaires ; des cours d'agriculture et du mat√©riel p√©dagogique pour les √©coles primaires. Tous servent leur objectif de promouvoir la justice et la souverainet√© alimentaires, et leurs efforts ont fait de leur duo un membre fiable du syst√®me alimentaire de Fairbanks. ü•í

With trees around Fairbanks starting to leaf out, we‚Äôre seeing new species arrive almost daily. While the capture rates have been relatively modest‚Äî38 newly banded birds and 9 recaptures since Monday (May 16th), it‚Äôs always a treat when a migrant species ends up in the nets for the first time of season.

Highlighted are a few newly-arrived species from the past week: 

(1) A second-year male Varied Thrush, caught on 5/16. This species was not caught at Creamer‚Äôs Field last spring.

(2) A male Orange-crowned Warbler showing a hint of its eponymous often-concealed crown, caught 5/17

(3) A Northern Waterthrush, first caught 5/18

Given the late-arriving spring, the arrival dates for most of these species appear to be a few days behind normal. But we hope that will make for some good late-season migration pulses next week!</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CdzcPJlrtC1>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src=''></td></tr><tr><td>05/21/2022 01:18:25</td><td>64.8356, -147.733</td><td>lathrop_hs</td><td>Lathrop High School</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/lathrop_hs>link</a></td><td>Total years working in education:  I have been a teacher for 24 years, 20 at Lathrop.

It was cool to witness these young drone pilots join community leaders in advocating for their land and village infrastructure. The project resulted in a short digital story which I will share soon. @senlisamurkowski happened to be making a site visit the following week and the youth shared their digital story with her.

I feel like the various craft divisions at the Fair (and the handcraft legacies within our communities they represent)have an unfair reputation as dowdy or dated and I really like challenging that perception by entering pieces that reflect current textile technologies and modern design sensibilities yet still fall firmly within the handcraft tradition.

Here‚Äôs a handy visual aid: an excursion vessel with approximately one hundred people on board.

You can catch just a glimpse of the glacier behind Sawyer Island in the distance. I was on a similar excursion this time last year, so I opted out of shelling out the $185 for the up-close-and-personal look.

Carnival has a ‚Äú110% refund‚Äù policy on its shore excursions if you find one that‚Äôs less expensive, with the caveat that it has to be THE SAME TOUR. Same amount of time, does the exact same things, etc. Obviously a lot of wiggle-room there! I booked my excursions wirh ShoreExcursions.com, with interesting things to do that cost much less. I‚Äôm not an influencer, so I‚Äôm not paid to plug the website. You should check it out if you‚Äôre cruising, though.

These two rivers are located in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region and both empty into the second largest river in Alaska: the Kuskokwim River.
 These watersheds are especially vulnerable to ongoing climate change as they are on the boundary of the continuous permafrost zone. With warming temperatures and the retreat of permafrost, the watersheds will likely experience rapid change. 
  Throughout the next couple of posts, we‚Äôll be talking more about our trips on these rivers.

Leaving Chena Hot Springs we had several goals for the day, the biggest of which was tracking down a brand new custom knee brace that Alissa was fitted for before we left San Diego, and that she had delivered to the resort. She had been trying to get a straight answer from from the front desk staff on the location of the package ever since we arrived. The morning we left, she finally learned that the package had been delivered to the corporate office, about an hour away in North Pole, Alaska. So off we went! The GPS led us astray but we finally found the office, and the package. Alissa was a very happy camper! 
North Pole, AK is a real city that has adopted a Christmasy theme every day of the year. Even the streetlights are painted like candy canes! So where do you think our next stop was? Yep!! Santa‚Äôs Haus! The big man wasn‚Äôt in that day, so we settled for some fudge and meeting his reindeer team; my favorite was Blitzen.</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CgVbG8lpnkL>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src=''></td></tr><tr><td>05/31/2022 11:51:23</td><td>64.751, -147.352</td><td>willplawson</td><td>Will Lawson</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/willplawson>link</a></td><td>Get to the chopper ‚õÑÔ∏è#onlocation</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CeOK1xYKJ-d>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src='../../../Program Data/Images/ImagesIG/a7eda6798e41e31e5c84036804fa739a.jpg'></td></tr><tr><td>09/05/2021 04:06:14</td><td>64.753377628, -147.3399370909</td><td>desertpaddleboards</td><td>Sarah Williams</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/desertpaddleboards>link</a></td><td>Reindeer are better than people ü¶å üéÑ This was one of our favorite stops in the North Pole!

Our prayer is that this surgery gives us some answers. A little over a year ago, we started to have conversations about the possibility of endometriosis. In the Lord‚Äôs kindness, he switched things around so my dear friend, Sara a doctor of anesthesiology could be on my care team.‚Å£
‚Å£
Throughout these four years, I have put my hope in this medication or that procedure or a feeling ‚Äòthis is our month.‚Äô And every month I was let down. Sometimes it would take me multiple weeks to recover emotionally. My hope is not in this surgery. Whatever the surgeon finds, I know my God is still in control. He is not sometimes sovereign or occasionally victorious. He doesn‚Äôt occupy the throne one day and vacate it the next day. ‚Å£
‚Å£
If you didn‚Äôt know:‚Å£
Endometriosis effects 1 in 10 women. It is the leading cause of infertility. üåà It is difficult to diagnosis, the only way to know for certain is through surgery. The severity of your pain is not always a reliable indicator of the extend of your condition. You could have mild endometriosis with severe pain or advanced endometriosis with little or no pain.

What is this feast day? 

On Sunday, June 5, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI spoke of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus in his Angelus: ‚ÄúIn biblical language, ‚Äòheart‚Äô indicates the center of the person where his sentiments and intentions dwell. In the Heart of the Redeemer we adore God‚Äôs love for humanity, his will for universal salvation, his infinite mercy. Practicing devotion to the Sacred Heart of Christ therefore means adoring that Heart which, after having loved us to the end, was pierced by a spear and from high on the Cross poured out blood and water, an inexhaustible source of new life.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs a day to celebrate the physical heart of Jesus Christ as the visual representation of God‚Äôs divine love and compassion for the world. The heart that loved us to the end. 

It‚Äôs no coincidence that Roe v. Wade was overturned today. üôåüèº

Sacred Heart of Jesus, I trust in You.
Sacred Heart of Jesus, I believe in Your love for me.
Sacred Heart of Jesus, Your kingdom come.

Besides being a great friend and wonderful person Sarah P has long been an invaluable leader in the Anchorage music scene. We can't express how much we all appreciate her hard work and dedication.
Sarah is going through a second battle with breast cancer and this show is a tribute to her fight. All money raised will go directly to Sarah to help offset the tremendous financial burden of cancer treatment.
Koot's is proud to present a bar wide party featuring a stellar lineup with some of Anchorage's best bands performing on both stages:
Alaska Thunder Funk
The Rezz (ft Terry Sharp of Bad Charlotte)
Them Bones
Decepticide
Devilwitch
she
Part Time Super Heroes
Mindful Khaos
Entry is a $10 minimum donation at the door. There will be tons of great auction items up for grabs as well as a pop up vintage clothing store.
In true Koot's and Family Tree style, let's rally all the support we can for our friend.
If you would like to donate items for silent auctions please contact Erica Calloway at ebcalloway23@yahoo.com.
If you would like to donate to Sarah's cancer fund but cannot attend there is a GoFundMe set up for her here: https://gofund.me/ffc4c992

The Nenana Land Back Campaign is uplifting Indigenous Nenana residents' visions for regenerative food systems, cultural connection & holistic land stewardship. Not only do they have a powerful vision, they are already engaging young people in small-scale ecological agriculture along with the hunting, trapping, fishing and gathering that has been practiced on these lands for generations.

The energy is palpable when Eva Dawn Burk shares about how the Nenana Native community is ‚Äúworking together to preserve our culture and how we are educating our kids about the lands around them. Our people have been disconnected for a long time and this culture camp is a way to bring the community together and reconnect, teaching our people how to be advocates for our land and that they are sovereign people.‚Äù 

Leadership of the Toghotthele Village Corporation, which is a major landowner affected by this project, has serious concerns about the rushed land sale this year. Decision-making went forward without their input. The proper studies and tribal consultation need to be complete beforehand.

Only took 24 years but if I was going to experience snow for the first time, might as well do it right and go to Alaska. The whole drive out to eagle river nature center my eyes were wide taking in the white peaks that surrounded the winding road leading out towards the nature center. Within forty minutes of our departure from Anchorage I was standing in powdery white magic enamored by the winter wonderland I was wrapped up in. The only thing that made it better was when two pups ran up playing in the snow‚Ä¶ it felt like Christmas as a kid and it‚Äôs only October.

The title of my Alaska Art Tile is "Arctic Snowflakes" and the colors are remindful of the patterns seen in the lakes and rivers in Interior Alaska when they freeze up over the winter.

Copies of the journal are available in Fairbanks and Anchorage, and at many small bookstores around Alaska.

They were able to observe the difference between the operations on a Ro-Ro vessel and Matson‚Äôs Lo-Lo vessel. In addition to a yard tour, Captain Karl from the Midnight Sun spoke to the cadets about life onboard, positions on the vessels and even walked through education pathways into maritime like SIU and the maritime academies.

The first ten years I substituted then I took a position as a Speech/Language Assistant.
Favorite LHS memory: Some of my favorite memories were from substituting because I always had a funny story to tell my family. Such as, the time substituting in a math class and having no clue what they were doing, so I would ask the students "Who knows how to do these problems?" They were good about taking over; then we all learned.  Also the last few years working with my young creative co-worker has been great. Love her energy.
What you will miss most: In August, I will miss seeing all the students, getting to know them and watching them grow and see their journey.
Plans for Life after Lathrop: My plan is to help my son out in Anchorage for awhile; then eventually move to Arizona and be outside as much as possible, enjoy continuing learning to draw and paint, and possibly travel.
Words of Wisdom: Learn to forgive often and always stay humble; then you will go far.</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CdzSR4_FFBm>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src='../../../Program Data/Images/ImagesIG/69f8f00810c01df52732f91664b857c6.jpg'></td></tr><tr><td>09/27/2022 04:38:12</td><td>61.2106395, -149.8283635</td><td>canny.brandon</td><td>Canny Brandon Thomson</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/canny.brandon>link</a></td><td>This is the best motivation out there!

This camp is where the Iditarod mushers send their dogs for summer to endurance train for the 1000 mile sled dog race from Anchorage to Nome. Learned a lot of interesting facts about mushing. Our guide is currently training to compete in it! We got a history lesson in mushing, got to watch them hook up the dogs, got a 20 minute ride on their summer sled, then finished with puppy socialization. They start training their puppies at 6 months. These dogs are lean, and full of energy. They run 3 times a day, burn up to 10,000 calories a day, and run 12 to 16 miles an hour. These dogs are so loved, and taken care of.

My grandparents were both devout Catholics so I went to say hello to them and lit candles for them in the chapel. 

I also prayed that we had an amazing and safe trip, and we did! Everytime I pray to God/Mother Nature to see wildlife I do! Saw so many bears, beaver, porcupine, more humpbacks at once than our guide had seen in a long time, stellar sea lions, dalls porpoise, eagles galore etc. 

Even if you're not religious, it's a peaceful place to take a walk or take in a gorgeous sunset‚ù§üåÑ

Alex signed up for the CrossFit + Nutrition package which offers unlimited CrossFit classes and a dedicated nutrition coach ‚ú®üí™üèº

Alex was coached by Deborah @poweryourlifenutrition ‚Ä¶here‚Äôs his testimonial üî•

‚ö°Ô∏èWhy did you decide to sign up for the CF¬†+ Nutrition package?

‚ÄúI initially needed someone to hold me accountable with my nutrition¬†and eating habits. I was already super active with Crossfit prior to nutrition coaching, but I was not content with my physical appearance and wanted to actually see the results from intense workouts pay off. 

Coach Deborah was incredibly approachable and knowledgeable with nutrition and fitness, so I thought it would be a no-brainer to go with the Crossfit Northern Exposure and Nutrition bundle.‚Äù

‚ö°Ô∏èHas your eating habits changed since starting the nutrition program? If yes, how so?

‚ÄúMy eating habits have changed just slightly. I was already eating fairly healthy foods to begin with, but what the program taught me was to slow my eating down and to eat until I feel satisfied. 

Throughout my life, I was constantly trying to finish and clear my plate. Now, I can set my meal aside when I feel full and box up food at restaurants¬†to save for later!‚Äù

‚ö°Ô∏èHave you seen a difference in your workouts? Recovery? If yes, how so?

‚ÄúMy workouts generally felt great while on the program! No real loss of energy. Eating slower never left me with any bloated feeling which could hinder any workouts later in the day.¬†

Coach Deb always did systematic¬†check up's with me. Seeing if I was eating enough to maintain energy levels for workouts and if my recovery periods were brief.‚Äù

I do have three negatives @alaskarailroad (1)The level of drunkenness (2) With the exception of the Seward route, there was no mask enforcement and (3) The impromptu political rallies that were occurring were extremely annoying.

Dawes is 15 miles long! Awe inspiring really when one is not blinded by the sun and the reflection on the snow. 

Also surprising was the Ship‚Äôs captains ability to move that ship so both sides could see the glacier #skills !

I feel so lucky to be able to say I cruised on fjords and saw (kinda) the majestic Dawes Glacier. 

Ignore me channeling Bernie Sanders Meme circa Jan 2021, for real I was freezing my butt off.  The water was like a mirror at times though, so worth freezing over.

.
The partnership between sled dogs and humans goes back thousands of years. These strong, unwavering four-legged friends served as a primary means of communication and transportation in variable cold weather conditions, much like the winters in Alaska. Even after the introduction of modern technologies like trains, cars, planes and snowmobiles, sled dog teams are still used today, particularly in Native villages.

A Sun Dog is an atmospheric optical phenomenon that consists of a bright spot to one or both sides of the Sun. The sun dog is a member of the family of halos caused by the refraction of sunlight by ice crystals in the atmosphere.

I am totally excited about my new bag thanks to @RRiveterbags

This Clara pouch fits everything I need to carry around in summer. It can be carried as clutch for a night on the town or as shoulder bag/crossbody bag. I love the great quality and craftmanship. 

It's handmade by military spouses. They create parts all over the country. This means the spouses can keep their jobs when their service member gets relocated. How great is that?!

A bag with a mission! 

Learn more about this cute pouch in my review on the blog and/or take a look at their collection.

Traditionally performed on Cedar(Sugi) wood.

This is a popular application for modern homes not only for its aesthetics, but for its long lasting durability. 

The burning process creates a thin layer of carbon that protects and seals the wood the same way stains would. It is very low maintenance and naturally resistant to insects and moisture damage. Lastly, this application is environmentally friendly and doesn‚Äôt contribute to harmful pollution in ways that other chemically treated woods may.

I did not get so lucky just yet. This place is called Beluga Point, and it is located a short drive from Anchorage üìç

Beluga Point is named for the white whales that are often spotted from this location as they make their way up and down the inlet. 

Belugas are often seen from mid-July through August when salmon are running in Cook Inlet. Belugas use sonar to find their way and catch fish in the silty waters of the inlet.

Even though I did not get to see Belugas, the views were absolutely fantastic there. Add this to your stop while exploring Alaska! Follow me üî≠ for more cool facts and wonderful places. Share your ‚ù§Ô∏è so I will know you enjoyed the content.

A few fun facts not in any order:
- 2 passenger coach cars (normally 3), 1 baggage car, 170 passengers, 2 locomotives on front and 1 on back. 
- Total duration , 8:35 duration, top speed in winter: 35mph (faster at up to 50 mph in Summer) for 235 miles.
- Flagship route between Fairbanks and Anchorage takes 12 hours at average speed of 30 mph during winter for 350 miles. 
- Cars built in 1989, customized for Alaskan conditions. These older coaches are more adept for cold conditions. Glass window dual level coaches are difficult to keep warm.
- One baggage coach and two dining coaches.
- Two locomotive provide pull and redundancy but the train has broken down before.
- Emergency food, rations, and blankets are loaded but with generators located on multiple cars, this hasn‚Äôt been cracked. 
- Load factors today at 100 percent. As low as 20 people for entire train during shoulder seasons and dark winter Jan-Feb
- Acquired from the Federal Govt‚Äôt and owned by the State of Alaska.
- Operates profitably with no taxpayer money.
- Freight service is true cash cow. 
- What excites passengers the most: seeing a moose 
- Company owns a number of rail barges with 8 tracks apiece for shipping rail cars from Seattle to railroads‚Äô southern terminus (along with Seward)
- Will operate most conditions down to -20 degrees. Issue isn‚Äôt safety but keeping coaches warm.
- WiFi and phone service very spotty along the way but who cares? The views are stunning!
- Summer trains are much busier May-August with glass dome coaches, first class, 7X weekly service, and routes extended down to Kenai Peninsula from Anchorage. 
- One of the last remaining flag stop trains in America where travelers can flag down the train and it will stop. They have had as many as 50 stops in a single trip. They build buffer into the schedule and can add speed to compensate but too many flag stops means late, late, late!
- Fairbanks to Whittier in Summer is longest route at nearly 14 hours.
- Longest winter route is 12 hour Fairbanks-Anchorage at 360 miles.

I love the entire cliffside fight between Octavia and Echo, everything about it is so badass - the location, the stakes, the tremendous struggle as two powerful warriors fight for their lives, the fact that it‚Äôs a freaking sword fight ‚öîÔ∏è But even more than that, I LOVE the little moment at the end where Echo‚Äôs heart shines through! üíñüêº She says the grounder blessing after death for Octavia, her supposed enemy, showing her an unnecessary kindness even though the fight didn‚Äôt turn out how either of them wanted. We start to realize that Echo isn‚Äôt some heartless villain, she‚Äôs just trying to do whatever she can to save her people, just like every other character on the show. (And then later she tries to comfort Bellamy by telling him ‚Äúit was a good death‚Äù, she doesn‚Äôt want to hurt him despite the fact they‚Äôre on opposite sides of a war.) Season 4 is such an incredible season and I just love Echo so much!!!

Chena Hot Springs Resort is one of the most unique spots we visited in Alaska. 

Located about an hour and a half outside Fairbanks, it gained popularity in the early twentieth century as a spa where prospectors could go to soothe their aching muscles. 

While visitors today are more likely to be families than gold seekers, they‚Äôre still looking to enjoy the hot springs! 

There are also hikes, a geothermal plant, a greenhouse, ATV rides and an ice museum. Plus plenty of gorgeous landscaping. 

We visited in the summer, but we think winter would be the perfect time to visit. Not only are there hot springs, the resort also runs aurora-spotting tours!

While our original plans were to celebrate in @denalinps , the weather caused us to change our plans.

We could not think of a better casual dinner location than @moosestoothpub .  We had been there a week before and it is an incredible place to eat.

We arrived around 4pm and was immediately seated.  Moose's Tooth is affiliated with @brokentoothbrewing and we have tried several of their beverages including Spooky Season.  We also have enjoyed their Root Beer and Cream Soda.

Moose's Tooth stays as busy as we have been told.  We expect to eat at Moose's Tooth in 2023.  We need to try Bear Tooth Grill a day Bear Tooth Theatrepub too.

Have you eaten at Moose's Tooth?

The goal of the party is for the kids to have fun while they get photographed & interviewed. We put their photos and bios on the heartgalleryak.com website & also in frames so we can have a mobile gallery. Behind me is the mobile gallery hanging up at the Tudor @kaladibrotherscoffee. Every month the mobile gallery is hung at a different location. Please check out the website &/or go grab a coffee & check out the mobile gallery. These are amazing kids waiting for their forever family. .

Para os f√£s de romance com vampiros de plant√£o, esse livro √© pra gente. 

Assim que o livro lan√ßou j√° fiquei com aquela enorme vontade de l√™-lo, no entanto ouvi muitos coment√°rios de compara√ß√£o com Crep√∫sculo e por isso adiei um pouco a leitura. Mas o momento chegou e agora eu sei que foi a hora certa de ler ele.

O livro j√° inicia nos contando um pouco sobre como est√° a vida de Grace e o porqu√™ de ela estar de mudan√ßa para um lugar in√≥spito para ela: o Alasca. 

Ela est√° devastada devido a morte prematura dos seus pais, e por isso precisa ir morar com o seu tio na Academia Katmere pois ele √© diretor de l√°. Nesse lugar que √© completamente diferente de onde veio e totalmente perigoso, j√° que o frio desse lugar √© algo que pode mat√°-la em poucos minutos 

No entanto aos poucos Grace percebe que o frio √© o menor de seus problemas, levando-se em considera√ß√£o que a maioria dos alunos decidiu que ela n√£o seria bem-vinda na escola e a tratam como um nada. Pessoas essas que causam calafrios nela e agitam o seu sexto sentido, pedindo para que ela tamb√©m se mantenha longe deles.

A sua sorte √© que Macy, prima de Grace, se torna uma grande amiga, ajudando a se habituar da melhor forma no seu novo "lar". Macy √© divertida e sempre disposta a fazer de tudo para que Grace se sinta bem.

Mas sua prima n√£o √© o √∫nico motivo de fazer os seus dias ganharem um pouco mais de agito. N√£o quando ela conhece Jaxon, um cara totalmente misterioso e que tem o poder de mexer com os seus sentimentos e que exala perigo, no entanto ela n√£o consegue lutar contra a vontade de ficar ao seu lado, mesmo que todos avisem para ela se afastar dele.

At√© porque, ela vai descobrir que o verdadeiro inimigo nem sempre vai ser aquele t√£o √≥bvio.

Desejo √©, sem d√∫vidas, um √≥timo romance sobrenatural, com aquela pitada de emo√ß√£o que torna a leitura r√°pida e cativante. Depois que come√ßa, n√£o tem como parar de ler.

Espero que tenham gostado da resenha. E se voc√™ leu Desejo, o que achou?

I am lucky for so many reasons and blessed beyond measure stepping into this summer. The crew of dedicated professionals that make @ember_customfoods a reality have stepped up yet again. As I began my road to recovery this week Geoff took the reins and led the charge in the kitchen. His leadership of the team in the kitchen made production possible this week. For this I am grateful beyond what words can convey. Geoff, Ira, Isabella; well fucking done!!

Gordon and Mary are dedicated to service and giving back to the community, but as a couple, they have a passion to ensure those they are working with receive the care they need and deserve. They stand out as they are relentless in their advocacy efforts to ensure those they serve are safe. They are both highly passionate volunteers who radiate positivity and bring a sense of calm and comfort. One of their greatest gifts is their ability to develop meaningful relationships with those they have contact with. 

Together they embody the Catholic Community Service mission which is to serve others with dignity, care, and compassion.

I recently had the pleasure of training @ruiz.klo in Classic lash and Volume lash application two weekends ago!
-
She originally took my course last year but booked another because she wanted the private training as a refresher.
-
In all my trainings we obviously learn about lash application/ lash theory. But in my trainings we go into great depth about work life: business, taxes, clientele, potential income, obtaining that income, running a business, ext. so that when you leave you are ready to begin. No second thoughts! And even if you did, you have a lifetime worth of mentorship after my classes!
-
@ruiz.klo I‚Äôm proud of the improvement you‚Äôve made & I can‚Äôt wait to see where this takes you!

Curious about receiving a lash training? Shoot me a message and let‚Äôs get you started!

We learned about the Iditarod, got to see and interact with all the gear. I might be looking into how I can get into the race! Lol It sounds so awesome!! 1,100 miles in the winter from Anchorage to Nome. So cool!!

We walked over a suspension bridge and we got to meet all the puppies!!!!! Definitely a highlight for the kids (and me too! Lol). 

If you ever get a chance to do this!! I highly recommend  it!! The staff were so friendly and informative! We loved every minute of it!!

"Chloey is Was‚Äôineidi Tax‚ÄôHit, Eagle Wolf clan in Kake, Alaska and credits her commitment to community and culture from her grandfather Archie Cavanaugh. Born and raised in Southeast, Chloey believes that the panhandle of Alaska is more than the enchanting beauty it beholds, but a teacher, a way of life, and a distinct part of her Tlingit identity passed down from generation to generation. As a LGBTQ+ woman, Chloey takes pride in dedicating her spare time to various activism groups, exemplified by her role as Co Facilitator of Spectrum¬†a free, confidential, 12-week support group for anyone that is LGBTQ2+ and has experienced trauma, such as domestic violence and/or sexual assault, whether recently or in the past.¬†Chloey believes that Indigenous voices belong in all spaces and seeks to use her traditional Tlingit values to guide her decisions."

You can find Chloey @klawk.shaa and can find more information and her shop at¬†blackandwhiteravencompany.com GunalcheÃÅesh Chloey for sharing your artistry with us, and we look forward to working with you this year!

Princess Leia Organa was one of the greatest leaders of the Rebel Alliance, fearless on the battlefield and dedicated to ending the Empire‚Äôs tyranny. Daughter of Padm√© Amidala and Anakin Skywalker, sister of Luke Skywalker, and with a soft spot for scoundrels, Leia ranked among the galaxy‚Äôs great heroes and became a figure of hope. But life under the New Republic proved difficult for her. Sidelined by a new generation of political leaders, she struck out on her own to oppose the First Order as founder of the Resistance. These setbacks in her political career were accompanied by more personal losses (his son, Ben, trained by her brother, turned to the Dark Side of the Force and joined the First Order‚Äôs ranks), which she endured with her seemingly inexhaustible will.

Coup de coeur les amis, coup de coeur! Encore me direz-vous?!
Et bien ouiiii ü§ó.
Pourquoi donc üòØ ?
·ØΩ
Parceque c'est la magie de No√´l, parceque le sujet abord√© est d√©licat et pourtant si beau, parcequ'il fait √©cho √† certaines ann√©es de mon enfance et parceque les illustrations sont absolument sublimes, encore une fois.
·ØΩ
Lucas est triste car cette ann√©e, sa famille n'a pas les moyens de faire un beau sapin de No√´l, ni de s'offrir des cadeaux sensationnels. Il passe devant de belles vitrines, croisent des passants joyeux et se rappelle les mots de sa grand-m√®re : "Il y a de la magie dans l'air, la veille de No√´l".
·ØΩ
Et effectivement, en rentrant chez lui, Lucas sera bouscul√© par un ours blanc g√©ant, et tout √† coup, un √©norme magasin fera son apparition devant lui, un magasin o√π des pingouins parlent, ou des trains magiques circulent, o√π des flamands roses jouent de la trompette et o√π un l√©opard murmure aux oreilles des enfants. 
·ØΩ
Vous l'aurez compris, Lucas √† √©t√© propuls√©¬†dans un monde magique, hors du temps, o√π son imagination donnera vie √† ses r√™ves les plus chers, un endroit o√π tout est extra-ordinaire! Et nous lecteur, nous en prenons plein les yeux ü§©. 
·ØΩ
De ce moment incroyable, Lucas revient les bras charg√©s de cadeaux pour tous ses proches et il passera l'un des plus beaux No√´l de sa vie d'enfant, en cr√©ant un souvenir inoubliable gr√¢ce √† l'intention qu'il met dans ce doux moment de partage en famille. 
·ØΩ
On d√©couvre aussi vers la fin, en observant bien, pourquoi Lucas tient tant √† redonner le sourire √† ses proches et c'est vraiment tr√®s touchant. L'amour n'est-il finalement pas le plus important dans tout √ßa? 
·ØΩ
Voil√† une histoire qui r√©chauffera les c≈ìurs, en c√©l√©brant la magie de No√´l √† travers un petit gar√ßon fort, g√©n√©reux, et terriblement attachant. 
·ØΩ
Je vous le conseille tellement ce petit bijou!¬† J'esp√®re que vous arriverez √† mettre la main dessus, car il me semble que les √©ditions Kimane en ont fait une r√©impression, alors ne le laissez pas vous √©chapper!

They helped me 20 years ago when I was in need and now I have the honor of serving as their Board President.

Last month, we had our annual victim service awards banquet. Some incredibly deserving members of our community were honored.

We also celebrated two women who are retiring. One is the long-time lead advocate from VFJ and the other is Taylor Winston, Executive Director of Office of Victim Rights. Before Taylor had this position, she was once a Prosecutor. She was the prosecutor for my case nearly 20 years ago. She‚Äôs one of the most tenacious, intelligent, compassionate, and fierce humans I‚Äôve ever known. Having the opportunity to thank her for the many times she‚Äôs advocated for me over the years was deeply healing and a moment I‚Äôll never forget.

I also was blessed with a table full of people I love. Friends, family, and my incredibly supportive partner.

Experiences like this remind me that life can be meaningful. We can heal from trauma and make a difference in our community. We can give thanks to the people who have supported us when we needed it most.

I know that some days feel dark but please believe that there is light and you are worthy of healing.</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CeROdW5FshD>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src=''></td></tr><tr><td>08/17/2022 14:11:57</td><td>61.17087, -149.92023</td><td>travel_with_galwiththecamera</td><td>Rashi Sinha</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/travel_with_galwiththecamera>link</a></td><td>Fall is the best time to be in Alaska, you can catch the gorgeous colours in this heavenly place.

From Vimeo: This poetic short film takes a modern artistic approach reflecting on Siqi√±iq, an Inupiaq Indigenous woman, crossing the treacherous winter tundra. This hike through the tundra provides the symbolic backdrop of her struggles as a modern day warrior fighting corporate greed. What sets her story apart from other Indigenous social and environmental justice advocates is the internal conflict she is also faced with: her father being white has provided her a different lens to look through. The rest of the Inupiat tribe doesn‚Äôt fully accept her and her views as she is not considered full blooded Indigenous and although she grew up with the culture, she did not grow up on the traditional lands of her People. She also finds herself at the crossroads of the ancient traditions and the modern world. The film allows us to witness the multiple layers of both internal and external conflicts that have made her a complex, unique, and unforgettable warrior.

Refuge Information Technicians (RITS) are the connection between village residents and refuge management. Christopher Tulik of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge and Jacqueline Cleveland of the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge, both Yupik, will present on their work as RITS.

Christopher‚Äôs intimate knowledge of the Yupiaq language and culture, the local area and the people make him a valuable liaison between the Refuge and those who live in the communities on and around the Yukon Delta Refuge. He travels by boat, snowmachine and plane to make personal visits to dozens of small subsistence communities. During the visits, he informs residents about Refuge-related conservation work, hunting and fishing opportunities, and other topics that are important to subsistence harvest.  He also hears their concerns and local knowledge of fish and wildlife matters and ensures this is communicated to Refuge staff back at refuge headquarters.  Jacki is new to her role as an RIT for Togiak National Wildlife Refuge.  She will share with us the essence of subsistence life in her village of Quinhagak through her outstanding photography and videography.

So much has gone on in the last month that we've barely had a chance to be on here. This past week my father came into town to experience Alaska. I've not had the opportunity to see him as living in Alaska prevents frequent travel if you've not got the time or money. Seeing him visit every location on my broadcast journey has been nothing short of amazing. 

This morning at 3am, we sent him off to the airport and are now enjoying a MUCH NEEDED date to the movies üé¨

We do this with water temperature data loggers. These loggers are hammered into locations that are a good representation of the watershed, accessible for continual retrieval, and out of the way of potential large hydrological and geological events. These data loggers record water temperature and water pressure every hour. 
  We have these loggers placed in both the Kwethluk and Kisaralik rivers. On the Kwethluk River, we installed three water temperature loggers and five soil temperature data loggers (for permafrost) in 2019. The plan was to retrieve them in 2020, but that got pushed back to 2021. This year, a group of three SOTF members went to retrieve those data loggers, upload the data from the sensor, and continue collecting water samples along the river. 
  This group was able to successfully retrieve 1 out of the 3 river logger closer towards the headwaters of the Kwethluk and none of the permafrost loggers. The fact that we got one temperature logger was a success. These rivers can change fairly rapidly, and the Kwethluk River seems to be one of the worst. We believe we didn‚Äôt located all the sensors due to an increase in sedimentation which would bury it (sometimes under a couple of feet mud) or the braided channels changed enough to bury or displace it. Our favorite reason- a fox took the permafrost logger. We were able to find the cable, it had just been chewed to pieces. The logger that we did successfully retrieve gave us about two year‚Äôs worth of temperature data that you can see on the graph. 
  On The Kisaralik River we placed three water temperature loggers. One was placed right below the lake. One was placed on day four just before the braids started, and the last was placed in a small tributary. The logger that we placed in the small tributary was the hotspot for Arctic Grayling dry fly fishing. The grayling were flashing their beautiful dorsal fin out of the water and eating each of our dry flies. Each one prettier than the last. We‚Äôre excited to go back and check on that water temperature logger and the grayling.

The view was absolutely stunning! To travel here you must fist go to a small air strip and take a seaplane. While we flew we get to see the aerial-view of all the streams that were flowing with melted water glacier. It almost looks like a painting because the sides of the stream are mostly greenery and the streams were milky white!üèî‚Ä®.‚Ä®After we landed with the sea plane, the lodge consists of about 6-7 lodges (could be more but it‚Äôs a small place). The main lodge is where we have the only wifii connection and for the rest of the place we have none. Total zen and cut out from the rest of the world. Different activities are provided such as kayaking, hiking, fishing, sightseeing, etc. We aren‚Äôt allowed to carry anything with strong sense of smell (perfume, shampoo with strong smell, etc) because bears might knock on your door at night! üêªüçª
. 
Funny story: one morning we all gather in the main lodge and the lodge manager came in with a crushed canned beer. Apparently the whole crate was damaged and all beer was gone with smashed cans. The bears got into it the night before! Wonder if the bear could walk back up to the mountains without falling because they‚Äôre drunk! .
This lodge is also closed 9 months out of the year due to winter season. Each winter they recruit a volunteer who wants to stay for 9 months only to have a satellite phone (high pay of course). But stories from the lodge say they can get crazy when they are back after their long shift! .
.
Would you do it for a high pay? No internet for 9 months alone (OH AND MOSTLY DARK! 11 hours a day). Sounds depressing to me haha!

A few weeks ago we caught this young Chipping Sparrow - only the third one ever banded in this station‚Äôs 30-year history.

This species is common throughout the lower 48, but is found in much lower densities in the Alaskan interior. Juvenile sparrows can be hard to differentiate, but the dark line passing through the eye is a good field mark for Chipping!

Visitors are welcome to drop in and at the banding station Mon-Sat mornings - hope to see you there!

I love the simplicity of boarding a train, settling into a comfortable seat, and watching the world unfold in front of you. Train travel has a unique way of unveiling hidden gems to its passengers. You‚Äôre accessing places where roads don‚Äôt exist, and that can‚Äôt be fully appreciated by flying high above them in a plane ‚úàÔ∏è 

The scenery along the ride is constantly changing and never disappointing. I couldn‚Äôt help but stare out the oversized picture window and marvel at how truly incredible the landscape was. The Aurora Winter Train journey takes you over massive bridges, alongside frozen lakes and rivers of solid ice, and directly through the towering snow-covered mountain peaks of the Alaska Range.

The Aurora Winter Train 12 hour long‚Ä¶ but worth every single second to spend there ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

.
I'm 33 today. As the moon went thru all of its phases in last night's eclipse, I couldn't help but think of sudden change & transformation.
.
My brother turned 31 last night. It's like we shared the eclipse, like he passed me round fullness & light, which I slipped into my pocket before plunging willingly into pitch black dark.
.
Things HAVE been dark lately, for my dad, mostly. He had a stroke about 10 days ago, & things have felt & looked pretty bleak. Honestly, the hardest part is seeing him suffer, unable to do basic things, craving the smallest of simple things, & sometimes slipping into this all-encompassing fog of despair. It kills me that I can't save him. I'm his primary contact person, & I want to be there every day, but it's a lot. Luckily, I have the best help of my family. I want to show my dad that lunar light of transformation. I want him to feel, deal, & heal, just as I'm being called to.
.
As heavy as that all is, I know it's my job, at 33, to stop shoving suffering away, to stop resisting things that don't feel good. To LISTEN. To LEARN. I'm learning a lot in this. That I can nurture & care. That it's okay to wake up with a weight on your chest & just breathe as it ebbs & flows. I'm learning that I can see myself as an adult who can make serious decisions & have true conversations. I'm facing my guilt when I feel like I don't verbally express things "the right way", not soft enough, not eloquent enough, not certain... That my "me"ness is more than "shoulds" will dictate.
.
3 is about creativity, communication, & energy. 6 (33, or 3+3) is about family, nurturing, care.
.
I say, bring it. Bring it all for mercy, for growth, for transformation, for strength, for Love, for peace, for all.

I can envision all the drama unfolding now. My wife out there at the boat launch at Ship Creek with her binoculars, clipboard and note pad documenting the movements of beluga whales in the inlet and then all of a sudden there‚Äôs a plot twist that involves seals swimming around with their mouths full of salmon yet little do they know the Beluga Monitor Extraordinaire is overcoming inclement weather and is watching them. 

Yeah, that would be cool-ass movie but not as fascinating as my wife living her dream as a volunteer beluga monitor. She‚Äôs already seen a pod of belugas and gets the notifications of sightings. Pretty exciting stuff. I still can‚Äôt get over the fact that we were talking about this back in February like it was a wild pipe dream and now it‚Äôs vivid in 4K Ultra HD‚Ä¶ the real thing.

Our first excursion takes us out to Chena Hot Springs. 

BRRR!!! We bundle up as we enter the Aurora Ice Museum, the World‚Äôs largest year round ice environment.  Entering this igloo-like building felt like a giant walk-in freezer and looked like an ice castle filled with ice chandeliers and sculptures of all kinds. 

Next we wandered through Chena‚Äôs greenhouse to learn about the hydroponic technology used to grow peppers, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and other vegetables. 

There‚Äôs something brewing under our feet.  Deep inside the Earth, temperaturas are so hot that rocks melt into a bubbly brew. Following the greenhouse tour we learned how humans use this natural occurrence of heat to create geothermal energy.  Geothermal renewable energy source is heat within the Earth. 

The sound of dogs barking led us to the dog kennel tour. Two large dog pens were filled with a variety of rescued dogs.  These furry creatures offer dog cart rides in the summer and sled dog rides in the winter.  Although these specific canines do not participate in the famous Iditarod events you can learn all about mushing and this fascinating sport. 

We ended our visit with a soak in the hot spring.  This hot spring is heated by Geothermal heat, heat from the Earth's interior. We soaked in the hottest water we have ever experienced, temperature around 106 degrees. It felt rejuvenating! 

It was a fun-filled first full day in Alaska.  Time to Vote!  Which one of these would you want to experience? 

A. Ice Museum
B. Greenhouse
C, Geothermal Energy Tour

The title of my Alaska Art Tile is "Arctic Snowflakes" and the colors in my artwork are remindful of the patterns seen in the lakes and rivers in Interior Alaska when they freeze up and create contrasting blue and white patterns, much like snowflakes and clusters of water bubbles.

My other two artwork submissions were also printed inside the journal. Copies of the journal are available in Fairbanks and Anchorage, and at many small bookstores in Alaska, including Chitina, Homer, Juneau, Ketchikan, Palmer, Sitka, Skagway and Soldotna.

üåªPre-orders for my Alaska Art Tiles are available on my website - just click the link in my bio to visit my website and place your order. Thank you for supporting a small artist!

(he carries the proof proudly in a folder that he keeps in his pickup). It was an incredible story that he shared while standing at a pull-off of the Cook Inlet just south of Anchorage.
 The article read: In 1973 ‚ÄúAt the age of 22, Jim Dore crafted his plan. A business hired him to deliver a van from Illinois to Seattle. After his cross-country drive, he would fly to Juneau, catch a ferry to Skagway, ride a train to Bennett Lake near the Canadian border, then paddle a six-person rubber raft - which he bought from Sears for $89 - through 100 miles of interconnected lakes to the Yukon River. After floating the Yukon, he would get out at Circle, then hitchhike to Fairbanks.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHis plan was ambitious, perhaps even more so when you consider that his brother Bob came along for the ride, who just turned 13 and was fresh out of 7th grade.‚Äù
 Jim told me this story... all while appearing perplexed as to why i found it all so intriguing. Every question i had was returned with a ‚Äúwell because we could‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù.
 His story was full of what could be seen as incredible twists of fate or happenstance, but in all honesty this man just simply wanted it and then made it happen. 
 -He didn‚Äôt quit there.... he went on to work on the early years of the Alaskan pipeline. Afterwards, one day, he noticed a single engine plane sitting on a grass strip. He drove over to ask if he could pay for a plane ride to see the local country and the next week he says he began renting the aircraft for flying lessons everyday until obtaining his private pilots license. He then went on to work as a pilot, flying tourists and mountaineers onto Denali glaciers.
 When i asked what it was that brought him to a roadside pull-off that day he said ‚ÄúWell, I just followed the sunshine.‚Äù.... i then showed him 9 tiles of random pictures and asked him to pick out the ones with a crosswalk. Just to make sure he wasn‚Äôt a robot. Can‚Äôt be too careful these days.</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CIwnseSBxYN>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src=''></td></tr><tr><td>10/16/2022 19:43:40</td><td>58.29973, -134.40679</td><td>cuteasiantraveling</td><td>Ho√†ng Long L√™ Nguy·ªÖn</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/cuteasiantraveling>link</a></td><td>Arriving in port of Juneau in a RARE sunny day

The start of the season brings some of the earliest-departing species preparing to embark on their journey south. Alder Flycatchers are the most fleeting of all: the last species to arrive in the spring (early June), they typically are already leaving their breeding grounds by the end of July. That makes for a breeding season of little more than 50 days for this species‚Äîas emblematic of the short and sweet Alaskan summers as you can get! With wintering grounds as far away as northern Argentina, Alder Flycatchers are not ones to wait. 

Our banding station is currently operating 6 days/week, from about 6 AM to noon, and we are open to the public.

I got the chance to meet Nordic noodles, Aka Sled dogs Aka ALASKAN HUSKIES - before you‚Äôre like ‚ÄúBUT ITS SIBERIAN‚Äù just relax a second. Contrary to Hollywood portrayal, 98% of sled dogs in Alaska are mutts. They‚Äôre a mix of a lot of double coat breeds (‚ùÑÔ∏èmalamute, husky, etc‚Ä¶) with other stuff added for spice (üå∂German shepherd, border collie, etc‚Ä¶). They have one of the healthiest gene pools. In the Two Rivers area of Fairbanks, sled dogs outnumber people 4:1- some of the best mushers in the world live here- yes they‚Äôre called ‚Äúmushers,‚Äù which, pejoratively, is my slang for human infants. These dogs love to pull and are born with the instinct. In the summer, they train by dragging ATVs (pictured). The place we went to is called Just Short of Magic - run by Eleanor Wirts, a former educator and equestrian. These dogs are her life, and it shows - they are sweet and well cared for. Arguably most impressive, is that to turn left or right you use the commands GEE or HAW. I had to stifle my Arizonian desire to say ‚ÄúYEEHAW‚Äù or we woulda ended up in a ditch. #borzoi #husky #justshortofmagic #dogsofinstagram</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CiiRXTkJ8K_>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src=''></td></tr><tr><td>06/05/2021 22:23:02</td><td>64.8146072711, -147.7457284927</td><td>alaskaaxeco</td><td>Alaska Axe Co.</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/alaskaaxeco>link</a></td><td>HUGE happy birthday to the owner of our Fairbanks location, Kenny!

Together with the amazing team that the JAHC assembled, Liaise Studio had the distinct pleasure of designing the set for Wearable Art. Working with a dedicated team of artists, designers, lighting designers, media experts, and art enthusiasts, Christine utilized the theme, Joie de Vivre, as a starting point to create a vibrant backdrop to the beloved living art show. Following a collaborative charrette led by Liaise Studio, I was able to design a colorful and lively set‚Äîone that came alive through lighting, music, and the models showcasing the unique art.

We value the collaborative nature these types of projects engage us in. I have to commend our team on taking this challenging installation head on and fabricating it in a manner that makes me proud of them. #teamworkdreamwork  Here is the original post from @thenavespenard Posted @withrepost ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúNeighbors and visitors may have noticed the changing landscape in front of The Nave this summer! The MJ Murdock Charitable Trust has been a valuable partner in helping us put the finishing touches on The Nave renovation. They provided funding for everything from a new roof and steeple, to art restoration, to a new audio/visual system being installed this fall. 
Funding from the Trust helped us to connect a new deck on the front of the building to Our Lady of Spenard, the metalwork installation that once hung on the south fa√ßade of what was then called the Church of Love. Designed by Drew Michael, Our Lady of Spenard was fabricated by Garrett Perkins and installed by Chad Taylor of Intrinsic Landscapes as part of his Reclaiming Asphalt project in 2016-17, which aimed to show the potential to bring vibrancy to an asphalt-heavy streetscape. Chad and his team at Intrinsic faced a creative challenge in reconfiguring the installation after the renovation, and they succeeded in creating a street-front statement to Spenard Road. Thanks to the Murdock Trust, we were able to preserve this important piece of The Nave‚Äôs history.

We‚Äôre so excited to share this renovated building with visitors as we work to create a hub for community, culture and the arts.‚Äù

It‚Äôs the time of year we look forward to the most; spending almost every night in the backyard by the fire, dreaming up what we want to do next with the property, eating straight off of the grill, and watching the garden come to life.

Even though we‚Äôve spent the last seven years together raising animals and vegetables, there‚Äôs still a lot of uncertainty in what we‚Äôre doing.

Will this new feeding and watering system work?

Is this spot sunny enough for potatoes?

What grows well with rhubarb?

Do we even like collard greens?

The uncertainty, the novelty, the constant trial by fire is something we can‚Äôt get enough of. It‚Äôs the drive to always get a little better, and to learn something new, that motivates us to spend countless hours doing manual labor in the backyard.

I believe we, as humans, NEED challenges and a sense of overcoming.

We need to see the fruits of our labor.

We need to feel a sense of gratification, and to look at something and say, ‚ÄúI did that.‚Äù

What is the thing that you‚Äôre doing right now, in this season of your life, that is captivating your attention?

What is the thing that you‚Äôre whole heartedly committed to?

What are you going to step back from six months from now and say, ‚ÄúI did that‚Ä¶‚Äù proudly?

What project(s) are you undertaking that is challenging you new in ways?

Most importantly‚Ä¶

How do you feel about the answers above?</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/Ccw5SscuEE6>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src='../../../Program Data/Images/ImagesIG/af5e8a25744fa49e4b4e10a2b4dd5e2f.jpg'></td></tr><tr><td>04/09/2021 23:04:59</td><td>61.2170591625, -149.850789683</td><td>alyeskahelicopters</td><td>Alyeska Helicopters</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/alyeskahelicopters>link</a></td><td>Two milestones in one photo!

AND MOOSE. üòç

The Alaskan backcountry was a once in a lifetime view to see. BUT we were glad we only did a one way ticket to Fairbanks on the train, & flew back home because by hour 8 of the 12 hour ride I was antsy as all get out. ü§£ 

We saw over 20 moose during our ride‚Äîfinally!!!! They are probably the cutest yet ugliest animal I‚Äôve seen. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Someone at work asked me if I‚Äôve had moose meat yet, and I was like, ‚ÄúNO! Currently that‚Äôs like asking me if I‚Äôve tried kitten.‚Äùü§™

From Talkeetna to Fairbanks we stopped ever so often to check on residents who lived in the desolate areas. It was so interesting all the fun facts they would tell us about each ‚Äútown‚Äù we came to. For some of these places the train is their only way to get supplies or communicate to the outside world, because of having no cell service or transportation other than snowmobiles. It was very neat to witness and wild to imagine. üíï</td><td><a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CbKrKi4L-h6>link</a></td><td><img style='max-width:200px;' src=''></td></tr><tr><td>08/22/2022 20:45:04</td><td>64.839993117, -147.7125732408</td><td>falcons_take_flight</td><td>The Falc√≥ns üì∏ ‚úàÔ∏èüß≠</td><td><a href=https://instagram.com/falcons_take_flight>link</a></td><td>@RiverboatDiscovery Chena River Adventures üíô Athabascan village Chena Living Museum

A little more about me.. I started my cruise career in 2016 as Reservations Sales Agent for Holland America Line and Seabourn in The Netherlands. During the summer season the ms Rotterdam would dock weekly or biweekly in Rotterdam. Our office looks out over the cruise port so I would see the ship leave every time. My shift would end at 4pm and at the same time the ship was scheduled to depart. Everytime I stood on the quay waving our guests a great cruise (and wishing I could go with them..)

Ever since my first cruise(s) I knew that I would like to work onboard. In May 2017, that dream became real. I got the opportunity to work onboard the ms Rotterdam as Global Guest Assistant for 4 months. This was a temporary position within the Shore Excursions department. It's a function that only exists on ships that have Rotterdam or Amsterdam as homeport during the summer season. I had to translate from English to Dutch for our Dutch and Belgian guests onboard - the shore excursions catalogue, assist them in Dutch at the desk and give tour information, translate on the bus during their tours, etc. During this contract I visited great destinations like Norway, Baltic, Iceland and Greenland. From that moment, I was completely addicted to the life onboard! 
To be continued.. üõ≥

It‚Äôs been a lifelong journey to be comfortable in my own skin and story as a ‚Äúbrown‚Äù woman in America. Pero poco a poco I‚Äôm getting there and am committed to creating space for others to do the same through whatever avenues I can. 

Tengo mucho orgullo en la historia de mi gente y en yo mismo historia, but I‚Äôm still more fluent in Spanglish than Spanish and don‚Äôt honestly understand the full, complex history of my own people. I‚Äôm no one‚Äôs perfect Mexican daughter, but over the last few years I‚Äôve learned to show up as all of myself‚Äîboth in honor of my own journey and those in my lineage who sacrificed time and time again so I could even have an opportunity to occupy the spaces and have the dreams I do.

I will forever be the daughter of a scrappy little cowgirl and a gregarious small-town hero; the granddaughter of a steelworker and hardworking homemaker who had assimilation literally beat into them by a culture that ironically isn‚Äôt even the majority culture of our hometown. I will always be the great-granddaughter of immigrants who came to America in a cattle car for $0.35 a piece in search of a better life. 

No matter where I go, I will always stand on the shoulders of giants whom I will continue to honor for their meek greatness. I am grateful and genuinely privileged to have Leyba and Roldan blood flowing through my veins.

#ImageDescriptions :
1. Through multiple lenses, the Gulkana Glacier clings to her edges in the heat. A bright pink lens spot shines in the left corner.
2. A dirt road leads to numerous glacially sculpted features now covered in thick tundra and brush. Mountains line the distance. 
3. An alpine lake shines cool and inviting on an extremely hot afternoon.
4. A wide lake reflects puff clouds and blue sky while snow patches quickly melt along the rounded edges.
5. My bike rests on a giant green sign covered in a mess of stickers. ‚ÄòMaclaren Summit‚Äô barely readable under the stickers.
6. Fireweed‚Äôs sister river beauty holds a wager with how eye catching it can be against the burning sun. Magenta flowers dance to the beat of swans and sparrows.
7. 3am rest stop roses blooming in front of spindly black spruce and an epically calm, reflective lake shimmers in the early morning northern light 
8. A small plant with wool-like hairs and magenta flowers peaks/peeks in the rolling tundra. called Wooly  lousewort due to the fine hair protection in harsh winters.
9. A swath of white cottongrass grows thick in a wetland. Seed heads appear as cotton balls clustered together. 
10. Smoke-filled skies turn the sun and all the surroundings a hazy glowing orange. A river reflects this sun and sky and seems to ask ‚Äòhow long?‚Äô

It's been awhile since our last Fuzzball Friday but this will surely challenge even the most skilled hunter or birder!
.
Graduate student @calliebmoore took these pictures of this sweet hatchling in Alaska while working for the USFWS on Kigigak Island. Callie worked for three summers on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska before making the move to Arkansas for grad school. Callie said "I really think that taking a few years off to live the "technician" life between my undergrad and grad school allowed me to hone in on my interests and develop the necessary skills and knowledge to be successful."
.
As a mentor to undergraduates in our lab Callie is constantly encouraging them to be open to relocating to new areas of the country for technician positions during their summers. After all, she is Canadian and has worked all over North America, so she must be on to something.

With the tap of the election trickling in its seemingly indefinite way, it feels a little foolish to try and divert your attention elsewhere...BUT...

Today is Bandcamp Friday, which means that Bandcamp is waiving their share of revenue of all sales made on their platform to the artists who use it. In other words, all sales made on Bandcamp today (sans processing fees) goes directly to artists.

Given this, I will be donating all proceeds made from sales (with two exceptions, explained below) on my Bandcamp page today to @booksthroughbarsnyc , which has had all of its in person volunteering activities suspended due to the pandemic. 

I also just migrated the entire Rokenri back catalog to my Bandcamp page, as well as a song that I made with my friend Steve Markow, and lowered the price of the vinyl edition of Donkey Donkey to $12. 

As for the exceptions mentioned above: 22% of all proceeds made from sales of Mossing Around and Other Songs will continue to be donated to @thelovelandfoundation , and 100% of proceeds made from sales of Babble/Where Am I Going? will be donated to @nonewjails_nyc .

It was a great spot to sip hot chocolate, take in views, & snap a photo with these adorable red cabins. The typical shot here actually includes three cabins, but the snow was so deep we couldn‚Äôt make it far enough to shoot them without snowshoes! 

One of your requested topics (thanks @tracykhan88!) was how climate change is affecting Alaska. Climate change here means shrinking glaciers, receding sea ice, & thawing permafrost. 

According to the National Climate Assessment:
üî• Alaska has warmed twice as fast as the rest of the USA over the past 60 years 
üî• Alaskan average annual temperatures have increased by 3¬∞F & average winter temperatures have increased by 6¬∞F
üî• Spring snowmelt begins earlier annually, glaciers are seeing widespread retreat, the landscape is drier, & Alaska has experienced more insect outbreaks over the last 60 years. 
üî• Arctic summer sea ice recession is outpacing projections & is now expected to disappear entirely before 2050.
üî• With the late-summer ice edge located further north than in previous years, storms now produce larger waves & more coastal erosion. This has already led to one Alaskan village relocating & more on their way
üî• Alaska is experiencing the fastest loss of glacier ice on Earth
üî• With permafrost thawing, the ground is sinking unevenly & in 2014 was predicted to add $6B to the costs of buildings, pipelines, roads, & infrastructure over the next 20 years 
üî•Alaska has had more large fires between 2004-2014 than any other decade in record keeping history 
üî• Native Alaskans are expected to see declining availability of traditional foods & reduced access to sea ice hunting grounds
üî• Changing ecosystems is leading marine & terrestrial wildlife to relocate, interrupting food chains 

Overall, the present & future for Alaska is bleak when faced with climate change. I‚Äôve added a link to donate to the Alaska Conservation Foundation, which has focused on conserving & protecting Alaska‚Äôs bountiful wildlife for over 40 years. Please help if you can!

I love the simplicity of boarding a train, settling into a comfortable seat, and watching the world unfold in front of you. Train travel has a unique way of unveiling hidden gems to its passengers. You‚Äôre accessing places where roads don‚Äôt exist, and that can‚Äôt be fully appreciated by flying high above them in a plane ‚úàÔ∏è 

The scenery along the ride is constantly changing and never disappointing. I couldn‚Äôt help but stare out the oversized picture window and marvel at how truly incredible the landscape was. The Aurora Winter Train journey takes you over massive bridges, alongside frozen lakes and rivers of solid ice, and directly through the towering snow-covered mountain peaks of the Alaska Range.

The Aurora Winter Train 12 hour long‚Ä¶ but worth every single second to spend there ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

In the middle of July 2018, Kyrie Irving took to his IG stories to reveal a three-piece Kyrie 4 collection inspired by three popular kid-friendly cereal options. This pair is dedicated to Kix and Lucky Charms. Dressed primarily in red, its midfoot Swoosh ushers in a gradient rainbow pattern that matches its speckled midsole, reminiscent of the aforementioned marshmallow charms that Lucky the Leprechaun is always trying to protect. Its focal point is clearly its medial and lateral paneling that features debossed charm logos, from the tasty rainbow to the luck-infused clover. Much likes its Cinnamon Toast Crunch predecessor, its equips the cereal‚Äôs branding on its tongue with a gum bottom outsole that features outriggers with more hits of rainbow. üòç
