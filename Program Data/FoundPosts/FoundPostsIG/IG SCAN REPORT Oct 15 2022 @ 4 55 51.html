Since late May, we’ve had a dedicated crew on Perseverance giving this trail some much needed love and care. They've accomplished a lot in a short amount of time including:
🌊disassembling 2 damaged bridges and replacing them with culverts to direct water underneath newly constructed trail
⛰clearing landslide debris and reshaping the access trail from the parking lot
🌊removing rockfall from the horn (where the trail hugs the cliff at the beginning)
⛰smoothing out the trail tread by filling in washouts and digging out exposed rocks

While there’s still more to tackle, you can help! On Saturday, July 23, join us for a volunteer work day on Perseverance. We’ll provide the tools and training to allow everyone to take part, no experience necessary. RSVP now by heading to the link in our bio.

And a big thanks to Sage, Ambrose, and Laib as well as Mary, Toni, Jesse, Julio, Liam, and Sam for everything you’ve done so far.

We’re pumped to announce our second volunteer day of the summer on one of Juneau’s most popular trails, Perseverance. Join us on Saturday, July 23 from 9am to 3pm to help address erosion and storm damage from the last two years. 

Our Persy crew has been hard at work fixing broken bridges (stay tuned for more soon), but there’s too much for them to do alone. With the support of the community, we’ll work on repairing the trail’s tread and managing how water flows off the trail to ensure it can handle the next big storm. 

No experience is necessary to volunteer. Trail Mix will provide all the tools and instruction, so all you need to do is RVSP. Link in bio or bit.ly/perseverancejuly23

Join us for the opening reception during First Friday, from 4:30-7pm on October 7 at the Juneau Arts & Culture Center. 

Chloey credits her commitment to community and culture from her grandfather Archie Cavanaugh. Born and raised in Southeast, Chloey believes that the panhandle of Alaska is more than the enchanting beauty it beholds, but a teacher, a way of life, and a distinct part of her Tlingit identity passed down from generation to generation. 

Chloey believes Indigenous voices belong in all spaces and seeks to use her traditional Tlingit values to guide her. 

"When it comes to my designs, I've always believed they should start a conversation: the conversations surrounding our past, present, and future. These conversations come from a place of healing, and ask that you lean in and listen. When you step onto indigenous land, you inherit the obligation to know the history, to hear our conversations, and to make space for us to dream and grow. This exhibit is an opportunity to shift from colonizer into an active community member supporting indigenous people to rebuild everything taken and build back and have the space to dream." 

Chloey's work will be on display October 7-29 and can be viewed during normal business hours: Tuesday-Friday, 9am-5pm and Saturdays, 10am-3pm. @juneau_arts_council
